Jose Manriquez, Texas A&M University '14 Computer Science
	
	I'm a computer programmer with a passion for design and innovation. I like to do web development the most but I'm not afraid to travel the dark paths of objected programming. I like to attend hackathons and write my own applications in my own time. I also have a special passion for video editing. I'm always looking for new opportunities, I learn from my mistakes, and I like keep improving in everything I do.
