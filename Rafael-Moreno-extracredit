Rafael Moreno, Texas A&M University 2016 computer Science
	
	I'm a hackathon lover. I go to any hackathon I can get reimbursed for whether it's in Texas, California, and Philadelphia. At PennApps, I used Android,and Parse as the backend to recreate Snapchat's functionality, but it lets you choose the pictures that you send from your phone gallery. I love trying to hack on new technology, and I recently picked up a Pebble watch that I can't wait to try out. Outside of coding, I love to play sports. I was the manager for the Texas A&M men's basketball team for the Fall semester and now just help out at the games. I also go salsa dancing and movie watching with my friends.
