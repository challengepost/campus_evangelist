  >I'm a Python & PHP developer. I develop web apps that have potential to make people's lives easier. I code & that's all I really do. I recently built [GitHub profile scraper](http://sahildua.com/projects/github-scrapper/), a scraper for GitHub profiles using Python, GitHub v3 API & web2py, which got appreciated by GitHub staff and received constructive feedback from them.
