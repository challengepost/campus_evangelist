Mason Everett, Purdue University '17 CS			
			
			I'm a hacker that is a freshman in Computer Science at Purdue. I've attended MHacks II & III, BoilerMake and a couple other small hackathons.
			I am also heavily involved with the hacker community at Purdue. I'm a member of Purdue Hackers and my most recent project was a google chrome extension called dogeify. (bit.ly/dogeify)
